# Unsupervised Data Analysis

We investigate the causal inference for the irony and sarcasm detection problem, which involves text analysis. Therefore, we apply the text-based causal inference algorithm, CausalText by Pryzant et al.. In addition to adapting CausalText to the irony/sarcasm detection problem, we extend confounders by using unsupervised data analysis.

While applying text based causal inference on irony/sarcasm detection problem, the categories or groupings within the text collection is considered as a confounder. In order to determine the subgroups, two different techniques, topic modeling and clustering, are used.

* "inputs" directory contains the input files that we used in our study.
* "figures" directory includes the clustering and topic modeling related figures.
